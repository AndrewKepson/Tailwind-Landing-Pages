    question: 'How Do I Start the Homebuying Process?',
    answer: `Getting pre-approved for a mortgage home loan is the first step that most people should make when they are considering purchasing a home. Understanding how much you are able to be approved for will help you know what size home to look for, which neighborhoods to consider, and how much money you will need up front as a down payment and to cover closing costs.`
  },
  {
    question: 'How Much Will I Have to Pay in Closing Costs?',
    answer: `Buyers usually pay no fees when purchasing a home. The seller of the home pays a fee to the listing agent to market the property, and this fee is typically split with the buyer's agent as a reward for bringing them a purchasing client.`
  },
  {
    question: 'How Much Will a Down Payment Cost?',
    answer: `On average, homebuyers pay 11% of the value of the home as a down payment. However, those numbers vary widely as first time homebuyers typically pay 3-5% down. Certain types of qualified loan programs, such as VA loans and USDA loans, require no down payment at all.`

  {
    question: 'Is a Home Inspection Really Necessary?',
